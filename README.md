This project enables users to **control system volume using hand gestures** detected via a webcam. By leveraging **MediaPipe for hand tracking** and **Pycaw for audio control**, the system maps the distance between the **thumb and index finger** to the volume level, allowing for a **touchless volume adjustment experience**.

## 📌 Features  
✅ Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe  
✅ Gesture-based volume control  
✅ Smooth and responsive adjustments  
✅ Works with any webcam  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (for video processing)  
- **MediaPipe** (for hand tracking)  
- **Pycaw** (for system volume control)
